## File Uploads

- **Audio Files** are stored in the `/public/uploads` directory.
- **Cover Images** are also stored in the `/public/uploads` directory.
- Files are accessible via URLs such as: `http://localhost:8080/uploads/temp/{file-name}`.

---

## Middleware

- **`authMiddleware`**: Protects routes to ensure only authenticated users can access them.
- **`upload`**: Multer middleware to handle file uploads for songs and images.

---

## Pagination

- The `getAllSongs` and `getAllPlaylists` endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:
  - `page`: The page number (default is `1`).
  - `limit`: The number of items per page (default is `10`).

Example:

```http
GET /songs?page=2&limit=5
```

## Error Handling

All routes return appropriate error messages and status codes in case of invalid requests or server issues.

- **400 Bad Request**: For missing fields, invalid data, or file upload errors.
- **401 Unauthorized**: For requests made without valid authentication.
- **403 Forbidden**: When a user tries to perform an action they're not authorized for (e.g., deleting a song they didn't create).
